<!-- History ================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="history">Our Mission</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is a free and open-source software library for
solar physics based on Python.</p>
  <p>SunPy is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar
  physics. SunPy is meant to be a free alternative to the
  <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/">SolarSoft</a> data analysis environment which
  is based on the <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx">IDL</a>
  scientific programming language sold by Exelis. Though SolarSoft is open-source IDL
  is not and can be prohibitively expensive.
  The aim of the SunPy project is to provide the software tools necessary so that anyone
  can analyze solar data. SunPy is written using the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python
  programming language</a> and is build upon the scientific Python environment which
  includes the core packages <a href="http://numpy.org">NumPy</a>, <a>SciPy</a>. The
  development of SunPy is associated with that of <a href="http://astropy.org">Astropy</a>.
  SunPy was founded on March 28, 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers
  at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">NASA
  Goddard Space Flight Center</a>. Thanks to the generous support of the ESA Summer of Code
  and the Google Summer of Code as well as contributors from around the world, SunPy is
  now a global project and is not associated with any individual institution.

<!-- Team ================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="team">The SunPy Organization</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is a living code base with many contributors. Anyone can and is
  welcome to get involved.<p>
  <p>SunPy (the project) is run by the SunPy organization. This organization was founded
  and defined by
  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0002.md">this document</a>.
  Its primary goal is to <i>facilitate and promote the use and
  development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based
  on the scientific Python environment</i>. The organization consists of a lead developer,
  a board of directors, and the developer community.
  The purpose of the board is to lead the overal structure and direction of SunPy
  while the lead developer works with the developer community to implement it.

<p>The SunPy board is composed of the following members (in alphabetical order)
<ul>
  <li>Monica Bobra</li>
  <li>Steven Christe (chair)</li>
  <li>Russell Hewett</li>
  <li>Jack Ireland</li>
  <li>Stuart Mumford</li>
  <li>Juan Carlos Martínez Oliveros</li>
  <li>David Perez-Suarez (vice-chair)</li>
  <li>Kevin Reardon</li>
  <li>Sabrina Savage</li>
  <li>Albert Shih</li>
</ul>

The SunPy Lead Developer is
<ul>
<li>Stuart Mumford</li>
</ul>

Members of the development community are too numerous to list here but a list of anyone
who contributed code to SunPy is available on Github. Anyone is welcome to participate
in the SunPy organization.

<!-- Versus ============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="versus">SunPy versus SolarSoft</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is an alternative to the popular SolarSoft analysis environment</p>
  <p>The IDL-based SolarSoft analysis environment is a mature and rich code base to do
  Solar physics. Unfortunately not every person or institution have the capital necessary
  to fund a yearly IDL license. With the rise of scientific computing in Python new tools
  are now available to make developing the basics of a solar data analysis environment
  straightforward.

  </div>
  <p class="lead">If you have used SunPy in your scientific work we would appreciate it
  if you would acknowledge it.</p>
  <p>The continued growth and development of SunPy is dependent on the community being
  aware of the use SunPy. If you use SunPy, we therefore ask that you acknowledge SunPy
  appropriately in a publication or presentation (poster or talk).
  <ul>
  <li><b>For a publication</b>, we recommend the following line be added to the conclusion
   or acknowledgements<br><br>
