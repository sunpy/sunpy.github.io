  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is a free and open-source software library for 
solar physics based on Python.</p>
  <p>The SunPy project aims to <i>facilitate and promote the use and 
  development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based 
  on the scientific Python environment.</i>
</p>
<p>
  SunPy is written using the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python 
  programming language</a> and is build upon the scientific Python environment which 
  includes the core packages <a href="http://numpy.org">NumPy</a>, <a>SciPy</a>.
  SunPy also makes heavy use of the <a href="http://astropy.org">Astropy</a> package, and the 
  SunPy team also contribute to the development of Astropy and vice versa.

<!-- Team
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="team">The SunPy Organization</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is a living code base with many contributors. Anyone can and is 
  welcome to get involved.<p>
  <p>SunPy (the project) is run by the SunPy organization. This organization was founded
  and defined by 
  <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0002.md">this document</a>. 
  Its primary goal is to <i>facilitate and promote the use and 
  development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based 
  on the scientific Python environment</i>. The organization consists of a lead developer, 
  a board of directors, and the developer community. 
  The purpose of the board is to lead the overal structure and direction of SunPy 
  while the lead developer works with the developer community to implement it.
  
<p>The SunPy board is composed of the following members (in alphabetical order)
<ul>
<li>Steven Christe (chair)</li>
<li>Russell Hewett</li>
<li>Andrew Inglis (secretary)</li>
<li>Jack Ireland</li>
<li>Stuart Mumford</li>
<li>Juan Carlos Martínez Oliveros</li>
<li>David Perez-Suarez (vice-chair)</li>
<li>Thomas Robitaille</li>
<li>Albert Shih</li>
</ul>

The SunPy Lead Developer is
<ul>
<li>Albert Shih (interim)</li>
</ul>

Members of the development community are too numerous to list here but a list of anyone
who contributed code to SunPy is available on Github. Anyone is welcome to participate
in the SunPy organization.

<!-- History
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">The SunPy project is a free and open-source software library for 
solar physics.</p>
  <p>SunPy was first created in 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">NASA 
  Goddard Space Flight Observatory</a> on nights and at weekends. SunPy was created to provide a free alternative to the <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/">SolarSoft</a> data analysis environment which is based on the <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx">IDL</a> scientific programming language sold by Exelis. Though SolarSoft is open-source IDL is not and can be prohibitively expensive. The SunPy project has grown to include around 30 contributors to the code as well as many other people who have helped the project in various ways.
</p>
<p>
Recently, SunPy has become more involved in the Astropy community as both projects try and solve common problems. The most significant recent development is the creation of the SunPy organization, described above, which is designed to provide the SunPy project with stability and guidance into the future.

<!-- Versus
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="versus">SunPy versus SolarSoft</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is an alternative to the popular SolarSoft analysis environment</p>
  <p>The IDL-based SolarSoft analysis environment is a mature and rich code base to do 
  Solar physics. Unfortunately not every person or institution have the capital necessary 
  to fund a yearly IDL license. With the rise of scientific computing in Python new tools
  are now available to make developing the basics of a solar data analysis environment 
  straightforward.

<!-- Community

  </div>
  <p class="lead">If you have used SunPy in your scientific work we would appreciate it 
  if you would acknowledge it.</p>
  <p>The continued growth and development of SunPy is dependent on the community being 
  aware of the use SunPy. If you use SunPy, we therefore ask that you acknowledge SunPy 
  appropriately in a publication or presentation (poster or talk).
  <ul>
  <li><b>For a publication</b>, we recommend the following line be added to the conclusion
   or acknowledgements<br><br>
