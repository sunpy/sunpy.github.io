<!-- Documentation
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="docs">Documentation</h1>
  </div>
  <p>The SunPy <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/">documentation</a> 
  should be your first stop to get your question answered. We strive to provide
  a rich and comprehensive set of docs. The documentation is included in the code itself
  which you can access through <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/reference/index.html">code reference</a> 
  and we also have a number of <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/index.html">guides</a> which take
  you through specific topics. If you do not find your answer there read on!

<!-- The Mailing list
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="list">The Mailing list</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone. 
  SunPy has two mailing lists; a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy">general </a>
  mailing list for general issues and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev"> developer</a>
  mailing list. If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list.
  If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or 
  how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use
  the developer mailing list.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Chat Room
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="chat">Live Chat</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
  We have a chat room on IRC (#sunpy) hosted on <a href="http://freenode.net">freenode</a> where you can talk 
  with SunPy users and developers in real time. If you are unfamiliar with IRC we 
  recommend you simply use matrix.org <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/login" target="_blank" >web chat client</a> which will open directly in your browser, or use the embedded client below.
  Stop by and say hello. Also, most chat programs can connect to the chat room (hostname = irc.freenode.net, channel = #sunpy).
  The matrix.org channel is bridged into the IRC channel. If you are already using IRC, you can find the link to the matrix.org at the top. You can click there which will redirect you to the below page.
