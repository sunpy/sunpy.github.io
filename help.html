<!-- Documentation
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="docs">Documentation</h1>
  </div>
  <p>The SunPy <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/">documentation</a> 
  should be your first stop to get your question answered. We strive to provide
  a rich and comprehensive set of docs. The documentation is included in the code itself
  which you can access through <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/reference/index.html">code reference</a> 
  and we also have a number of <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/index.html">guides</a> which take
  you through specific topics. If you do not find your answer there read on!

<!-- The Mailing list
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="list">The Mailing list</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone. 
  SunPy has two mailing lists; a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy">general </a>
  mailing list for general issues and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev"> developer</a>
  mailing list. If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list.
  If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or 
  how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use
  the developer mailing list.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Chat Room
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="chat">Live Chat</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
   
  We have a chat room on <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sunpy-general:matrix.org" target="_blank" >matrix.org</a> which will open directly in your browser, or use the embedded client below.
  Stop by and say hello. Talk with the SunPy users and the developers and get started.
  If you are using IRC hosted on freenode, then you can join the same channel (bridged into matrix) by joining the (#sunpy) channel on freenode.
