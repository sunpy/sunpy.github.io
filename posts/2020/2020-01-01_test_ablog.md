# Test blog: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 at SunPy has been a blast!

## The Student Developers

As in previous year in 2019, in 2020 **SunPy** also have been blessed to host three *GSoC student developers*.
Abhijeet Manhas and Raahul Singh were based out of **India** while Kris Stern was based out of **Hong Kong**. 

## The Projects 

Each student developer had been matched with mentors and assigned one project each, as is the usual custom of GSoC.
The following are the projects for 2020, all of which have been successfully completed during the 3-month long program:

* glue-solar - Kris Stern ([https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6025721211781120/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6025721211781120/))
* Metadata searches using Fido - Abhijeet Manhas ([https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6373058639560704/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6373058639560704/))
* Solar Weather Forecasting using Linear Algebra - Raahul Singh ([https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4893913812303872/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4893913812303872/))

## The Mentors

As with any student project, the direction of mentors is instrumental in a successful outcome. 
We have been very fortunate to have the following mentors to help guide the respective projects:

* Cadair (Fido / glue-solar)
* dpshelio (Solar Weather)
* Monica Bobra (Solar Weather)
* Nabobalis (Fido / glue-solar)
* Shane Maloney (Solar Weather)
* Sophie Murray (Solar Weather)
* Thomas Robitaille (glue-solar)

Special mention goes to Laura Hayes for her contribution to the Fido project in a mentor-like capacity.
