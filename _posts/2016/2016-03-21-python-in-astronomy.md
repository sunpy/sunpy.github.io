Steven Christe ([@ehsteve](https://github.com/ehsteve)) and Stuart Mumford ([@Cadair](https://github.com/ehsteve)) got to attend the (great) 
[Python in Astronomy](http://python-in-astronomy.github.io/2016/) conference
which took place in Seattle Washington from 21-25th of March 2016.

An introduction to SunPy was presented by Steven and you can find the presentation 
(and citation) at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/48637). 

Great discussions took place on future plans for [NDData](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/nddata/index.html), 
a new Time Series object (https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/pull/12) in Astropy, among many others.
