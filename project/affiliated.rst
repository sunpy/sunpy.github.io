Affiliated Packages
===================

An affiliated package is a Python package related to Solar Physics that is not part of the sunpy core library, and is not managed by the SunPy project but is a part of the SunPy Project community.

*What are the benifits of this?*

Requirements to be satisfied:

*  The package must make use of and build on appropriate features in the core SunPy library.
*  The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of the package.
*  The code should provide an easy to run test suite.

Please look at `SEP-4`_ to read about our policies surrounding affiliated packages.
